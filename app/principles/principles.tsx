A firm's Culture is in its Principles. 
*These principals were John Whitehead( The John Whitehead of GoldmanSachs) orginal creation. We use them to model our day to day operations. We must never strive far from them. Or we will fail. 

1. our client's interest always come first. Our experience shows that if we serve our clients well, our own success will follow. 
2. Our assets are people, capital and reputation. If any of these are ever lost, the last is most difficult to regain. 
3. We take great pride in the professional quality of our work. We have an uncompromising determination to achive excellence in everythign we undertake. Trhough we may be invovled in a wide variety and heavy volume of activity, we would, if it came to a choice, rather be best than biggest. 
4. We stress creativity and imagination in everything we do. While recognizinf the old way may still be the best way, we constantly strive to find a better solution to clients' problems. We pride ourselves on having pioneered many of the practices and techniques that have become standard in the indsutry. #TODELETE
